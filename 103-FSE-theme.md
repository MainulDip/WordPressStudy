### FSE Theming (Full Site Editing):
My thinking is derailed ðŸ¤ª I'm tied up to the tracks 
The train of consequences ðŸ’€ There ain't no turning back
### `theme.json` Configuration file | Optional but foundational:
it's a configuration file for enabling certain wordpress settings, style specific elements and blocks, and which templates and template parts to register.

`theme.json` configuration will be reflected in places like the `post`, `template`, and `site editors` in the WordPress admin. Custom styles, in particular, will be reflected in the Styles interface

Some of the things you can do with theme.json are:

- Enable or disable features like drop caps, padding, margin, and line-height.
- Add a color palette, gradients, duotones, and shadows.
- Configure typographical features like font families, sizes, and more.
- Add CSS custom properties.......
- Register custom templates and assign parts to template part areas.

### hierarchy of different `theme.json`, low to high:
- WordPress default theme.json
- Theme's theme.json will overrides the defaults
- Child theme theme.json: If active, will override parent's theme.json
- User configuration: Users can further customize how their site works under Appearance > Editor in the WordPress admin, and the JSON data is saved in their siteâ€™s database. Their choice takes priority over all other levels in the hierarchy.......

There are also filter hooks available that let plugin and theme authors override the values dynamically. https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/07/05/how-to-modify-theme-json-data-using-server-side-filters/.......
