### FSE Theming (Full Site Editing):
My thinking is derailed ðŸ¤ª I'm tied up to the tracks 
The train of consequences ðŸ’€ There ain't no turning back


### Generating Block Theme:
2 most suggested methods are `using latest wordpress official theme` and/or using `Create Block Theme` official plugin.

The `Create Block Theme` plugin is an official, first-party plugin that WordPress contributors maintain. The plugin is more robust and it has many more options for exporting theme. One thing it does not support yet is uploading a custom screenshot. 

### Data & Plugins for theme development (official):

Plugins to aid theme development https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/#plugins

`Theme Check` Tests theme for compliance with the latest WordPress standards and practices
`Debug Bar` Adds an admin bar to the WordPress admin and provides a central location for debugging
`Query Monitor` Allows debugging of database queries, API requests, and AJAX used to generate theme pages and functionality
`Log Deprecated Notices` Logs incorrect function usage, deprecated file usage, and deprecated function usage 
`Monster Widget` (classic themes only) Consolidates the core WordPress widgets into a single widget, making it easier to test them all at once 


### `theme.json` Configuration file | Optional but vvi:
it's a configuration file for enabling certain wordpress settings, style specific elements and blocks, and which templates and template parts to register.

`theme.json` configuration will be reflected in places like the `post`, `template`, & `site editors` in the WordPress admin dashboard. Custom styles, in particular, will be reflected in the Styles interface

Some of the things you can do with theme.json are:

- Enable or disable features like drop caps, padding, margin, and line-height.......
- Add a color palette, gradients, duotones, and shadows.
- Configure typographical features like font families, sizes, and more.
- Add CSS custom properties.......
- Register custom templates and assign parts to template part areas.

### hierarchy of different `theme.json`, low to high:
- WordPress default theme.json
- Theme's theme.json will overrides the defaults
- Child theme theme.json: If active, will override parent's theme.json
- User configuration: Users can further customize how their site works under Appearance > Editor in the WordPress admin, and the JSON data is saved in their siteâ€™s database. Their choice takes priority over all other levels in the hierarchy

There are also filter hooks available that let plugin and theme authors override the values dynamically. https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/07/05/how-to-modify-theme-json-data-using-server-side-filters/.......
